### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Niamh (pronounced 'nee-uv'), (she/her). I am originally from Ireland, but have been living in Estonia for many years. I am a React.js front-end developer who is learning backend, Next.js, and TypeScript. I am also interested in data analytics and am learning SQL, NoSQL, R and data analysis with Python.

My public socials are linked from [**my homepage**](https://niamhdoyle.dev/). (I am working on a new version â€“ watch this space!)

A sample of projects to date can be found [here](https://niamhdoyle.dev/#section-work).

I recently graduated the [Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp](https://codeop.tech/coding-bootcamp/) at [CodeOp.tech](https://codeop.tech/), where we built both front-end projects with Vue.js and React.js and full stack projects with React.js, Express and MySQL.

I have experience using Python, TypeScript, Jest.js, Prisma, Drizzle, Vercel, Next.js, Postgres JSON, Snowflake and other technologies.

I am currently enrolled in the [Associate Data Analyst in SQL career track](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/associate-data-analyst-in-sql) with [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/).

I have also earned 2 course certificates from Udemy for completing the following courses:

- [Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/)
- [The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)

I like boardgames and tabletop roleplaying games.

I am a former highschool languages teacher. I have a PhD. in Linguistics. I love languages and speak Irish Gaelic, French, and Estonian conversationally. I also know some basic German and Finnish. Presently I am focused on improving my Estonian and German.

Stack: React.js, Next.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
