### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Niamh (pronounced 'nee-uv'), (she/her). I am originally from Ireland, but have been living in Estonia for many years. I am a React.js front-end developer who is learning backend, Next.js, TypeScript, PHP and Laravel. I am also interested in data analytics and am learning SQL, NoSQL and data analysis with Python.

My public socials are linked from [**my homepage**](https://niamhdoyle.dev/). (I am working on a new version â€“ watch this space!)

A sample of projects to date can be found [here](https://niamhdoyle.dev/#section-work). My favourites are:

- [KÃ˜do](https://github.com/niamh-d/refactored-pancake): A WIP full stack web application to assist parents in homelife management. Uses React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Daisy UI and Material Icons in the frontend and Express and MySQL in backend.
- [T3 Gallery](https://github.com/niamh-d/t3-gallery): A full stack image gallery web app built with Next.js, TypeScript and Vercel Postgres. Deployed online [**here**](https://t3-gallery-zeta.vercel.app/).

I recently graduated the [Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp](https://codeop.tech/coding-bootcamp/) at [CodeOp.tech](https://codeop.tech/), where we built both front-end projects with Vue.js and React.js and full stack projects with React.js, Express and MySQL.

I have experience using TypeScript, Jest.js, Prisma, Drizzle, Vercel, Next.js, Python and other technologies.

I am currently enrolled in the [Associate Data Analyst in SQL career track](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/associate-data-analyst-in-sql) with [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/).

I have also earned 2 course certificates from Udemy for completing the following courses:

- [Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/)
- [The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)

I like boardgames and tabletop roleplaying games.

I am a former highschool languages teacher. I have a PhD. in Linguistics. I love languages and speak Irish Gaelic, French, and Estonian conversationally. I also know some basic German and Finnish. Presently I am focused on improving my Estonian and German.

Stack: React.js, Next.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
