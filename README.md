### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Niamh (pronounced 'nee-uv' or 'neev', either is fine), (she/her). I've been learning to code for 3 years, starting in 2020. I spent the first year studying Python. Then I pivoted to JavaScript, and in late 2022 I studied how to build responsive websites with CSS. In early 2023 I started to learn React.

I have earned 2 course certificates from Udemy:

- Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS (https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/)
- The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert! (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)

I like boardgames and tabletop roleplaying games.

I am a former highschool languages teacher. I have a PhD. in Linguistics. I love languages and speak Irish Gaelic, French, and Estonian conversationally. I also know some basic Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian, German, and Scottish Gaelic.

I currently work in Anti-Money Laundering compliance for a fintech.

My goal is to get employed as a front-end developer by the end of 2023.

Stack: CSS/Sass, JavaScript, React.
