I have earned 2 course certificates from Udemy for completing the following courses:

I like boardgames and tabletop roleplaying games.

I am a former highschool languages teacher. I have a PhD. in Linguistics. I love languages and speak Irish Gaelic, French, and Estonian conversationally. I also know some basic Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian, German, and Scottish Gaelic.
